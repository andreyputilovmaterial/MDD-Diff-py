# MDM-Diff-mrs
This is the original version that was working absolutely smoothly for several years. I used it in all my projects, and all was working as expected.

I am calling it now v1.0 release. The v2.0 release is new clearer attempt implementing most of the code in python and not using mrs script to read mdd.
